Open the "algo" folder with DrakonTech.

Note that there is a file solution.json in the "algo" folder. solution.json sets the project's language to "human".
That tells DrakonTech to treat the project as an AI-prompt.

Build the progam using drakongen like this:

drakongen --project fizzbuzz.proj --output .

drakongen will overwrite fizzbuzz.txt
Use fizzbuzz.txt a prompt for an AI app like Grok, Gemini, or ChatGPT.
