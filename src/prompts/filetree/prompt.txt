Write a CommonJS module that implements the pseudo-code that I will send you in the next message.

Use fs.promises

Preserve the original logic as much as possible.

Export the following functions:
  createFolder,
  getFolder,
  updateFolder,
  openFolder,
  getHistory

Make all exported functions async.

If a function is not exported and does not contain "await", that function must not be async.

To generate unique ids, create this global object:
let globalIdCounter = 2;
Do not create any other global objects.
